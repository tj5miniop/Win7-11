# Win7-11
Am archive of the Windows 7 transformation script provided by Revert8Plus from Gitlab. Currently, the files are hosted on archive.org but the download speeds are quite slow depending on where you are.


# DISCLAMIER - NOT MY WORK 
this is purely just an archive of the files and the script 

# How to run 

either git clone the repo or download the sorucecode. run start.bat 

Any issues with the script eg - some apps installing and not all, use control panel to remove all the apps. Run the script again, reboot and then run the script yet again
